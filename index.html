<h2 style="color: #2e6c80; text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2>
<h2 style="color: #2e6c80; text-align: justify;">What exactly is this?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are studying how the effects of sonification methods (sound feedback based on user interaction with a system) towards Blind and Visually Impaired (BVI) people may affect the development of Assistive Technologies. This experiment is a first trial for using sonification methods in navigational tasks. The activity will involve an anonymous online questionnaire being sent out both to BVI and sighted people. They are expected to:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Test the sonification methods on their own computer, using a mouse and headphones;</li>
<li>Answer the questionnaire and send us their responses anonymously.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The entire experiment takes about 30 minutes and its tasks require the users to move a mouse around a surface and listen to audio feedback. The collected data will help us understand which sonification methods have the best performances for two-dimensional hand navigation tasks for different variables, such as cognitive load, usability, time taken, and precision.</p>
<h2 style="color: #2e6c80; text-align: justify;">How is that going to help BVI people?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By understanding the best audio feedback to guide a person in a particular activity, it is possible to optimize the time they take in it, how accurately they can perform it, how confident they feel while doing it, and even minimize the mental and physical effort needed for it. Most BVI people rely on memorizing object locations and refining the search for them by reaching out their arm in a physical search based on touch. However, some surfaces can be dangerous, uncomfortable, or even disgusting to touch, such as a hot stove, or a dirty garbage can. By guiding the user's hand via sound, a sonification system can precisely inform the location of a kettle handle or the top of a bin, without having to touch any surfaces to find it.</p>
<h2 style="color: #2e6c80; text-align: justify;">Why moving a mouse? I'm fine with a keyboard.</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We only use the mouse as an easy metaphor for moving your hand. In a face-to-face experiment, we would use technologies that enable the user's hand to be tracked while performing customary activities, such as boiling water on a stove. Given the pandemic, we decided to perform the experiment in a remote setting, letting users participate from the comfort of their own house. For this, we adapted the experiment to only use tools most people will have at their disposal, such as a computer, a mouse, and headphones.</p>
<h2 style="color: #2e6c80; text-align: justify;">Who is behind these tests?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are researchers from <a href="https://rmit.edu.au/">RMIT University</a> (Melbourne, Australia). Our project team includes:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/contact/staff-contacts/academic-staff/v/van-schyndel-dr-ron">Ron van Schyndel, Ph.D. (Senior Lecturer)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/contact/staff-contacts/academic-staff/z/zambetta-associate-professor-fabio">Fabio Zambetta, Ph.D. (Associate Professor)</a></li>

</ul>
<h2 style="color: #2e6c80; text-align: justify;">Is it safe to participate?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The experiment was approved by RMIT's College Human Ethics Advisory Network with a <em>Risk classification</em> of <strong>Negligible/Low.</strong> During the experiment, you will only be asked to answer a few anonymous questions, download our application to your computer, listen to audio feedback on your headphones and move the mouse around. The application will send your results automatically via the internet, without any other data being logged or uploaded. After the tests, you are free to delete the application from your computer.</p>
<h2 style="color: #2e6c80; text-align: justify;">Can I know more about the outcomes of this research?</h2>
